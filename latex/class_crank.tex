\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This class performs the \doxylink{class_crank}{Crank} Nicolson finite differencing scheme for pricing European and American Option, for non-\/constant risk free interest rate. 

option pricing 

This class is able to price Vanilla Options with the \doxylink{class_crank}{Crank} Nicolson finite differencing numerical method, for a non constant interest rate, using linear interpolation over the points in time given. It does for no dividents, meaning the American and european values shoudl be the same and can be compared to the Black Scholes explicit model. The class provides the ability to compare the two types of options, and validate performs using the explicit method.
